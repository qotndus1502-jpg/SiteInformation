"""SiteInformation API entry point.

Wires the FastAPI app together — CORS, then a `app.include_router(...)` call
per domain. Every request handler lives in a `routers/*.py` module; auth
dependencies are in `deps.py`; shared state (Supabase client, env constants,
in-memory caches, business helpers) is under `services/`.
